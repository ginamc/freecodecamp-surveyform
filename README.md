## How to Use

You can [visit my CodePen.io app here](https://codepen.io/ginamc/pen/MLZobr) and play with the form. You can fill the text areas, and click on the dropdown, radio, and checkboxes in the form. The `submit` button also changes on hover. You can click `submit` but it isn't linked to anything and just resets the form. Input areas that don't meet requirements will be dictated in red when you attempt to hit submit.
